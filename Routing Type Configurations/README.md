# üöÄ Routing Types Configuration Collection

This repository contains various **routing types** configurations implemented using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. The projects include configurations for **OSPF**, **EIGRP**, **RIP**, and **Static Routing**. Each configuration demonstrates the application of these routing protocols and their specific use cases within a network environment.

## üìÇ Included Routing Configurations

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)**
This section contains the configuration for **OSPF**, a dynamic routing protocol that uses link-state information to build routing tables. The project demonstrates how to configure OSPF on multiple routers, set up areas, and manage route propagation.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)**
The **EIGRP** configuration demonstrates the use of this hybrid routing protocol, which combines features of both distance-vector and link-state protocols. The project includes configuring EIGRP on routers, setting up autonomous systems, and understanding its path selection mechanism.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)**
The **RIP** configuration showcases the use of the RIP protocol, a distance-vector routing protocol. The project focuses on setting up RIP on routers, configuring network statements, and troubleshooting common RIP-related issues.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Static Routing**
This section demonstrates how to configure **Static Routing**, where routes are manually defined by the network administrator. The configuration highlights scenarios where static routes are preferred, such as small networks or specific routing needs.
