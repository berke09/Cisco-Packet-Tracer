# 🚀 Cisco Packet Tracer Configuration Collection

This repository contains a collection of various Cisco Packet Tracer configurations, covering a wide range of network technologies and scenarios. The configurations are designed to demonstrate different aspects of networking, including access control, NAT, routing, wireless setup, and more. These projects are ideal for students, professionals, and anyone looking to enhance their networking knowledge and skills.

## 📂 Included Configurations

### 1️⃣ **Access List Configuration (ACL)**
This section contains configurations demonstrating the use of Access Control Lists (ACLs) to control network traffic and enhance security. These configurations include both standard and extended ACLs for filtering traffic based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols.

### 2️⃣ **NAT Configuration**
This section covers configurations for **Network Address Translation (NAT)**, including both Static and Dynamic NAT setups. These configurations show how to manage IP address translation in small to large network environments.

### 3️⃣ **Mid-Sized Network Configuration**
This section includes configurations for setting up a mid-sized network, typically involving multiple subnets and devices. The configurations focus on efficient IP addressing, routing, and inter-network communication.

### 4️⃣ **Enterprise Network Configuration**
The **Enterprise Network Configuration** section demonstrates the setup of a large, scalable network that includes multiple routers, switches, and access points. It covers the design and implementation of enterprise-level network topologies and routing strategies.

### 5️⃣ **Routing Type Configuration**
This section contains configurations for various **routing types** including static, dynamic (RIP, OSPF), and routing protocol configuration. These examples will help you understand how to implement routing protocols to enable communication between different network segments.

### 6️⃣ **Switch and Router Configuration**
This section includes the configuration of **routers and switches** in different network scenarios, focusing on VLANs, inter-VLAN routing, and other key network services. The configurations will help you understand how to manage and configure Cisco network devices effectively.

### 7️⃣ **Wireless Configuration**
The **Wireless Configuration** section demonstrates the setup of wireless networks, including access points, wireless routers, and associated security configurations. These setups will show how to implement wireless connectivity and security in various environments.
### 8️⃣ **NAT-PAT Configuration**
This section covers the configuration of **NAT (Network Address Translation) and PAT (Port Address Translation)**, which is used to map multiple private IP addresses to a single public IP address using different port numbers. The configurations in this section demonstrate how PAT can be implemented to enable multiple devices on an internal network to access the internet using a single public IP address.
