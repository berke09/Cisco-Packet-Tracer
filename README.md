This repository contains network simulation projects created using Cisco Packet Tracer. The projects include features such as automatic IP assignment to different VLANs through DHCP servers, inter-VLAN communication, routing protocols, and security mechanisms like ACL and NAT. Each project is designed to visually and practically apply network theories.
