# üöÄ Cisco Packet Tracer Access Control List (ACL) Configuration Repository

This repository contains various Cisco Packet Tracer configurations demonstrating the use of **Standard ACLs**, **Extended ACLs**, and **Named ACLs**. These configurations are designed to showcase how ACLs can be implemented to control network traffic, enhance security, and manage access in a Cisco network environment.

## üìÇ Included Configurations

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Standard ACL Configuration**
A standard ACL allows you to permit or deny traffic based solely on the source IP address. This configuration demonstrates how to create and apply standard ACLs to control traffic flow between different network segments.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Extended ACL Configuration**
An extended ACL provides more granular control by allowing you to filter traffic based on source and destination IP addresses, as well as protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.). This section demonstrates how to configure extended ACLs to filter traffic based on both the source and destination.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Named ACL Configuration**
Named ACLs offer the same functionality as standard and extended ACLs but are configured using names instead of numbers. Named ACLs provide a more organized and readable approach to ACL configuration. This section includes examples of both standard and extended named ACLs.
