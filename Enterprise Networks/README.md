# üöÄ Enterprise Network Projects Collection

This repository contains a set of **Enterprise Network** projects designed and configured using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. The projects include a variety of network setups for different use cases, including a **Dormitory Network**, **Company Network**, and **Campus Network**. Each project demonstrates a different aspect of enterprise networking, such as routing, switching, security, and network management.

## üìÇ Included Projects

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Dormitory Network**
A network setup designed for a dormitory, where multiple rooms are connected to a central network. The configuration includes the use of routers, switches.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Company Network**
A company network setup that involves connecting different departments within an organization. This network configuration includes multiple VLANs for different departments, inter-VLAN routing, network security measures such as ACLs, and connection to the outside world via a firewall. This project demonstrates how enterprise networks are segmented for better security and efficiency.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Campus Network**
A campus-wide network setup that connects various buildings within a campus environment. This configuration uses multiple routers and switches to provide internet connectivity, inter-building communication, and scalability for future expansion. The network also includes wireless access points and redundant connections to ensure high availability.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Otel Link Network**
A otel network setup ensuring secure and efficient communication between guests, staff, and administrative units. It includes OSPF for dynamic routing, VLANs for segmentation, port security, SSH for secure access, banner configuration, static & dynamic IP assignment, and essential servers like DNS, DHCP, and web.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Distributed Branch Network**
A branch office network topology enabling secure and scalable communication between multiple city-based locations. It includes OSPF for dynamic routing, VLANs for segmentation, port security, SSH for remote access, banner messages, and support for static & dynamic IP configuration. The setup reflects a real-world enterprise structure focused on security and efficiency.
